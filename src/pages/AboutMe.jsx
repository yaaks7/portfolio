              <h3>Welcome to my portfolio</h3>
              <p>
                I'm a passionate mechanical engineering student with a strong interest in 
                quantitative finance, artificial intelligence, and software development. 
                My journey blends rigorous academic training with hands-on experience in 
                algorithmic trading, energy modeling, NLP, and AI optimization.

            <p>
              At the intersection of mathematics, code, and real-world impact, I build 
              tools that solve complex problems with clarity and precision ‚Äî from 
              backtesting trading strategies and pricing financial derivatives to 
              optimizing renewable energy systems.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              With a strong foundation in Python, C++, and React, I thrive on building 
              elegant solutions that bridge theory and practice.

            <h4>A little more about me</h4>
          <p>
            Beyond the screen, I'm someone who finds balance between logic and creativity. 
            I'm a lifelong basketball player ‚Äî the rhythm of the game has shaped my mindset: 
            strategic, fast-paced, and resilient. I also have a deep love for music and 
            sound design. As a former sound engineer and co-founder of a recording studio 
            in France, I've spent countless hours mixing, mastering, and helping artists 
            bring their vision to life.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            These passions taught me to listen closely, work collaboratively, and never 
            stop learning ‚Äî whether I'm on the court, in the studio, or writing code.
          </p>
